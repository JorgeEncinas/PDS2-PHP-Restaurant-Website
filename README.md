# About

This project is a PHP website made with the MVC architectural pattern. <br />
While making the restaurant's design, models, controllers, and views was the task given, I did not make all the files. <br />
At least the following were provided by the professor: <br />
- index.php file, which is responsible for handling the GET and POST requests <br />
- dbconnect.php file, which is responsible for establishing a connection to the database. <br />

Some of the contents of the website have been omitted from the repo to avoid copyright issues. This website is fake and not affiliated at all with any restaurant nor do I claim to own any information pertaining to a restaurant that may appear; it's just a homework assignment.

I tried to make a much simpler version of a certain restaurant's website, but you can see the design is not quite right, and the alignment is a bit iffy sometimes. Still, it was a great learning experience.

You can check the following video to see how the website is meant to look like, as I will not include the database nor the images.
